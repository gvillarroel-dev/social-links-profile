## Overview

![screenshot](./assets/images/thumbnail.png)

I built a social links profile card that serves as a centralized hub for sharing all social media profiles in one place. The project features a clean profile layout with an avatar, personal information, and a collection of styled social media buttons that users can customize with their own links.

### What I learned

- **Mobile-First CSS Architecture**: Building from the smallest screen size up taught me to write more efficient CSS and avoid unnecessary media query overrides.
- **Adaptive Typography Systems**: Implementing fluid typography that scales naturally across devices using CSS clamp() for optimal readability.
- **CSS Custom Properties for Theming**: Using CSS variables to create a maintainable color system that could easily be personalized or themed.

## Built with

- HTML5 Semantic Structure
- CSS3 Mobile-First Design
- CSS Custom Properties (Variables)
- Adaptive Typography (clamp, rem, em)
- CSS Flexbox Layouts
- Responsive Design Principles

## Features

- **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Built starting from mobile breakpoints and progressively enhanced for tablet and desktop experiences.
- **Adaptive Typography System**: Typography that scales fluidly across all screen sizes using modern CSS techniques like clamp() and relative units.
- **Complete Responsiveness**: Layout adapts seamlessly from 375px mobile devices to large desktop screens without breaking or compromising usability.
- **Clean CSS Architecture**: Well-organized stylesheet using CSS custom properties and mobile-first methodology for maintainable code.

This small but powerful [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) project reinforced essential CSS skills and responsive design patterns that are fundamental to modern web development.
